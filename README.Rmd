### Reproducibility instructions

This GitHub repository contains all the routines required to reproduce the tables and figures of the paper entitled “An approximate Bayesian approach for estimation of the instantaneous reproduction number under misreported epidemic data” published in XXXXXX. The repository is structured into four main folders (**01-Simulations**, **02-Figures**, **03-RealData** and **04-Complement**). Table 1 below indicates how to reproduce an object of interest (Object), the location of that object in the main manuscript (Section), the folder in which to find the desired routine(s) (Folder) and the R routines (Code(s)) required to reproduce the object of interest. <br>
<br>
The routine *simepi.R* is used as a subroutine to simulate epidemic data and *simul.R* is the core function to reproduce the simulation results in Section 3.1 (Scenario 1 – Scenario 6) of the manuscript. The different simulation scenarios have an associated seed, so that the results can be recovered exactly. In addition, the **02-Figures** folder contains routines to reproduce Figure 1, 4 and 5, respectively. Figure 2 and Figure 3 can be recovered with the routines in the **01-Simulations** folder. The **03-RealData** folder contains the algorithms to reproduce the real data applications in Section 4 of the paper (together with Figure 6 and Figure 7). Table 1 has no associated folder as it contains ‘handwritten’ text that summarizes the setting of each scenario. Note that the computation time (real elapsed time) reported in the main manuscript is specific to an Intel Xeon E-2186M CPU running at a base clock speed of 2.90 GHz.
